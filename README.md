## Content

Content in this repository is organised in folders. Each folder correspond to a lesson and groups a set of artefacts used in the respective lesson. This is the current content of this repository:

### week-01
This project covers few example requirements to demonstrate coupling, cohesion and the KISS principle.

### week-02
This project implements all requirements for our fictitious system 01. The implementation includes SOLID principles, factory method design pattern, and advanced Java language resources.

### week-03
This project introduces layers. Whereas one layer covers business requirements, the other covers database management. The database management layer uses the Data Access Object pattern. This concludes all requirements for system example 01.

### week-04A
This project extends existent DAOs to include update and delete functionality.

### week-04B
This project uses the Template Method to reduce code repetition on DAO classes and to keep the persistence layer closed to change, but open to extension.

### week-05
This project features the use of the Template Method design pattern applied to 3 DAO classes of Siacoes system.

### week-07
This project introduces the Spring Boot framework. The framework is used to reproduce the persistence layer of software example 01.

### week-10
This project shows the use of MVC, Front-Controller and Application-Controller as implemented by Spring Boot. 

### week-13
This project groups projects week-10 (presentation layer), week-07 (persistence layer) and week-03 (business layer) into a single project.

### week-14
This project adds a service layer that provides REST services for Pais.
